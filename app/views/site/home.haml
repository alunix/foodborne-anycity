        %p If you think you have food poisoning in #{L10N["CITY"]}, please complete this form. The info will be sent to the #{L10N["AGENCY"]} so they can take any necessary action.
        %p Here’s more information about what happens next:

        %p Did we @reply you on Twitter? Here’s why.

        %p 
          We use computers & code to search Twitter for tweets related to food poisoning in #{L10N["CITY"]}. We do as much as we can to automatically zero-in on the tweets we think are really about a possible food poisoning case and really coming from #{L10N["CITY"]}. Then real humans review the tweets and @reply back to people with a link back to this page. #{link_to "More detail here.", page_path("about")}
